# Pipeline_Methylation_QC
# R Code pipeline to pre-process methylation data.

The main file you need is: QC_methylation_Script.R
This is the R file with a lot of comments and instructions how to step-by-step process your methylation data.
The folder addFiles contains all additional files needed throughout the pipeline.

Furthermore, all steps and file names are documented in QC_methylation_flow.pdf.
To have a good documentation about excluded samples/probes and file steps, please use a file like sample_steps_template.xlsx.

In Methods.docx you find a draft describing the steps done in this pipeline.

If you want to do a check with MixedUp Mapper, you find additional instructions and things you need in the respective folder.

Please remember to always cite the R packages and software used.
The main steps followed here are from:
